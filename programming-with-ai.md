# 🤖 Programming with Artificial Intelligence

This guide presents important points and a methodology for effectively using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in your programming process.

## 📌 Important Points

* **The Human is You!**
    * The process of thinking and creating belongs to the human who writes the code.
    * You are the one who possesses the domain of the entire context of your code.
    * Use AI as a tool to polish what you are creating.
* **Be Very Critical**
    * Carefully analyze all solutions given by the AI before implementing them.
* **AI Can Be the Starting Point**
    * Sometimes, we may have a little difficulty starting an algorithm.
    * Therefore, use AI as a means to start coding what you need.
* **Let's Go in Parts!**
    * Work with smaller code snippets that, if possible, have a complete context within themselves.
    * This helps the AI's analysis to be better and with fewer errors.

## 🛠️ Methodology

Have a critical sense and analyze your code, choosing the parts you believe need improvement. A good start is to think about **four pillars**: **performance**, **errors**, **security**, and **language style patterns**.

### 1. Send

* After choosing the code snippet to be analyzed, send it to the AI.
* Remember to send any and all code snippets, which will help the AI understand the context.
* When sending the code, you can send a text explaining its functioning and what the expected result is.
* *Tip:* Ask the AI to only respond that it has received the code and to take no action.

### 2. Analyze

* Ask the AI to analyze a code snippet and point out potential problems, according to the chosen focus, **without making code changes**.
* Read the potential problems listed and check if they all make sense.

### 3. Adjust

* Adjust the necessary code snippet based on the AI's explanation.
* If the AI has responded with a possible solution, this is the moment to apply the code suggested by the AI to your code.
* If you see the necessity, modify this code.

### 4. Verify

* After fixing a problem, ask the AI to **verify if the same was resolved**.

### 5. Test

* After the problem is solved, **test if the functionality of the code remains the same**.
* It is necessary to guarantee that the changes did not create any **side effects or new errors**.
